### Scope

This package should read the current status of your lifx light over the local network. There is a package to connect over the internet through the web api <https://github.com/cboettig/lifxr>

But I would like to read the current state of the light and send a different color.

This package should send a udp package over the network. and is based on the python package [lifxlan](https://github.com/mclarkk/lifxlan).

Current state of the project is: [![Project Status: Concept - Minimal or no implementation has been done yet.](http://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/concept.svg)](http://www.repostatus.org/#concept) [![Last-changedate](https://img.shields.io/badge/last%20change-2017--03--26-yellowgreen.svg)](/commits/master)
